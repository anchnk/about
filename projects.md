# Projects

As many developers working in corporations, most of the code I write isn't
visible publicly (my github's repository just being the visible tip of the
Iceberg). It also means my github's profile doesn't reflects accurately my
developer's activity.

Even though I truly believe in Open Source's philosophy my only option to
improve that situation is to lay down everything I did.

That's what this file is for.

## Orange

I worked at Orange from September 2015 to September 2017: this was my first
professional experience as a developer. Before working as a developer, I worked
for Orange on a call center during 11 years, programming during my freetime or
in between customer calls.

I joined the company when it started its digital transformation program. My team
had the responsability of building services for Orange's customers (i.e data
plans, bills, data consumption, services, contracts...).

When i started, my environment was:

- Big JavaEE monolithic applications.
- Eclipse as an IDE.
- Heavy use of JavaEE Best practices and Spring framework.
- SVN for source versioning.
- V-Model development process.

At the end, my environement was:

- node.js microservices.
- not using an IDE anymore, but mostly vim and tmux as a development workfow.
- Git and Gitflow for source control and versioning.
- Agile methods through SCRUM framework.

I am not stating one is better than the other. I am just underlining the fact
the company was in a dynamic transition and that I had the opportunity to learn
a broad range of techniques and technologies. Something quite standard for a
profesionnal developer.
