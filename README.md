# About

This repository is a place where you can find out:

- **Who I am**
- **What I do**
- **How I work**

... as a software developer.

My primary goal is to establish my **approach towards work in the IT industry**.

It will also reflect my **professional philosophy** and show my **journey as a
software developer**.

## Motivations

What are motivations behind such repository ?

### 1. Emphase closed codebases contributions

First of all, this place should reflects **what I did during my daytime job**.

As many developers working in corporations, most of the code I write isn't
publicly visible (my github's repository just being the visible tip of the
Iceberg). It also means my github's profile doesn't reflects accurately my
developer's activity. Closed source copyrighted codebases occults most of the
work one may have done in his career

Even though I truly believe in Open Source's philosophy my only option to
improve that situation is to lay down everything I did.

That's what this file is for: an attempt to enlighten the dark side of the
iceberg.

### 2. Improve social interactions

Second, at conferences / meetups, one of the first question that comes out is:
> so, what do you do exactly in your company ?

Which usually translates to:

- **What** kind of **products** are you building ?
- How **projects** are **run** and **structured** ?
- How do you go from **dev** to **production** ?
- What is your **role** in the **company** ?
- What is your **background** and **experiences** ?
- How do you **solve problems** and **difficulties** ?
- Which **programming languages** are you using ?
- What do you like / dislikes about them ?
- What are your **motivations for the future** ?
- And so on.

You should find answers to these questions in this repository.

### 3. Improve online visibility

Lastly, **remote companies** may determinate if my profile fulfills their
**requirements for a specific position**.
