## Podcasts

I am a huge fan of the [changelog](https://changelog.com) podcast. And I highly
recommend that everyone involved in the tech industry suscribe to their
newsletter. Thanks to them I discovered amazing projects and people.

I limited myself to follow 10 podcasts as it's already hard to keep the pace up.
That's the kind of list I would have like to have when I started. I hope it will
be helpful to somebody else.
