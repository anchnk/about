# About

This repository is a place where you can find out **about me**, **who** I am,
**what** I do and **how** I work as a software developer. My primary goal is to
establish my **approach towards work in the IT industry**. It will also reflect
my professional philosophy and show my journey as a software developer.

## Motivations

During my career, I traveled a bit and attended some conferences. One of the
first question I had to answer was: so what do you do exactly in your company ?

Which usually translates to:

- **What** kind of **products** are you building ?
- How **projects** are **run** and **structured** ?
- How do you go from **dev** to **production** ?
- What is your **role** in the **company** ?
- What is your **background** and **experiences** ?
- How do you **solve problems** and **difficulties** ?
- Which **programming languages** are you using ?
- What do you like / dislikes about them ?
- What are your **motivations for the future** ?
- And so on.

You should find answers to these questions in this repository.

I also plan to use this repository in order to build a **dynamic resume**, hence
the `json` files.

Lastly, **remote companies** may determinate if my profile fits their
**requirements for a specific position**.
